# Swagger/OpenAPI Documentation

Nest provides a dedicated [Swagger module](https://github.com/nestjs/swagger) to
generate an OpenAPI specification to document your API. This can be set up by following the instructions at
https://docs.nestjs.com/openapi/introduction.

Check out [src/main.ts](../src/main.ts) to see how this module is configured in
this project.
